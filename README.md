### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Felipe, a data enthusiast and musician. Here's a glimpse into what I bring to the table:

ðŸš€ **Currently Working On:** Delving into exciting private projects, exploring the intersection of data analysis and creativity.

ðŸŒ± **Constantly Learning:** Immersing myself in Python, SQL, R, and JavaScript to harness the power of data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.

ðŸ’¼ **Professional Background:** Senior Data Analyst with a knack for driving strategic decision-making and operational improvements. Experienced in healthcare operations optimization, new business development, and marketing strategies.

ðŸŽ¸ **Fun Fact:** When I'm not diving into data, you'll find me strumming the guitar with both hands â€“ a unique skill I've honed over the years.
